# RMTools
RMTools is a lightweight, user-friendly calculator tool designed for gym enthusiasts, powerlifters, and weightlifters. It helps you estimate your **one-rep max (1RM)**, calculate **rep ranges**, and determine **percentages of your 1RM** based on the weight and repetitions you input. Built with **React** and **Vite**, and styled with **shadcn/ui** components, this app is fast, modern, and easy to use.

## Features  
- **1RM Estimation**: Calculate your one-rep max using the Epley formula.  
- **Rep Ranges**: Determine your working weight for a given number of repetitions (1–12).  
- **Percentage Calculator**: Find the percentage of your 1RM for any weight.  
- **Clean UI**: A sleek, intuitive interface powered by **shadcn/ui** components.  
- **Fast Performance**: Built with **Vite** for lightning-fast development and production builds.
